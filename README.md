About Metricinga
================
Metricinga is a gevent-based metrics forwarder that parses performance data
files from Nagios/Icinga and sends the results to Graphite via the Carbon
pickle port. It is designed to be lean, extensible, flexible, and easy to extend or hack on.

Support for StatsD and other metrics backends (OpenTSDB?) is planned.

Requirements
============
* Python 2.6 or greater (older versions may work also)
* argparse. if using Python <2.7
* gevent 1.0rc1+, installed from GitHub
* gevent-inotifyx (optional, for Linux inotify support)
* nose (optional, for running unit tests)

Installation
============
Using pip:

    pip install git+https://github.com/jgoldschrafe/metricinga.git#egg=metricinga

To also install inotify support, use this instead:

    pip install 'git+https://github.com/jgoldschrafe/metricinga.git@setup#egg=metricinga[inotify]'

Configuration
=============

Configuring Nagios/Icinga
-------------------------
If you're already using Graphios, you're already set up to send metrics through Metricinga, and you can skip to the next section! If not, read on.

### Modifying the daemon configuration

The default performance data output format used by Nagios and Icinga can't be easily extended to contain new attributes, so we're going to replace it with one that prints key-value pairs instead. This will allow us to add in whatever kind of bookkeeping attributes we want! We need these to do things like override the display name of a service with a metric name more meaningful to Graphite.

We'll need to edit one of the following files:

* **For Nagios:** /etc/nagios/nagios.cfg
* **For Icinga:** /etc/icinga/icinga.cfg

Make sure that the following configuration keys are set to something like the values below:

    process_performance_data=1
    host_perfdata_file=/var/spool/icinga/host-perfdata
    host_perfdata_file_mode=a
    host_perfdata_file_processing_command=process-host-perfdata-file
    host_perfdata_file_processing_interval=60
    host_perfdata_file_template=DATATYPE::HOSTPERFDATA\tTIMET::$TIMET$\tHOSTNAME::$HOSTNAME$\tHOSTPERFDATA::$HOSTPERFDATA$\tHOSTCHECKCOMMAND::$HOSTCHECKCOMMAND$\tHOSTSTATE::$HOSTSTATE$\tHOSTSTATETYPE::$HOSTSTATETYPE$\tGRAPHITEPREFIX::$_HOSTGRAPHITEPREFIX$\tGRAPHITEPOSTFIX::$_HOSTGRAPHITEPOSTFIX$
    service_perfdata_file=/var/spool/icinga/service-perfdata
    service_perfdata_file_mode=a
    service_perfdata_file_processing_command=process-service-perfdata-file
    service_perfdata_file_processing_interval=60
    service_perfdata_file_template=DATATYPE::SERVICEPERFDATA\tTIMET::$TIMET$\tHOSTNAME::$HOSTNAME$\tSERVICEDESC::$SERVICEDESC$\tSERVICEPERFDATA::$SERVICEPERFDATA$\tSERVICECHECKCOMMAND::$SERVICECHECKCOMMAND$\tHOSTSTATE::$HOSTSTATE$\tHOSTSTATETYPE::$HOSTSTATETYPE$\tSERVICESTATE::$SERVICESTATE$\tSERVICESTATETYPE::$SERVICESTATETYPE$\tGRAPHITEPREFIX::$_SERVICEGRAPHITEPREFIX$\tGRAPHITEPOSTFIX::$_SERVICEGRAPHITEPOSTFIX$

### Configuring file rotation

Next, the rotation commands need to be configured so the performance data files are periodically moved into the Metricinga spool directory. Depending on your system configuration, these commands may be located in `/etc/icinga/objects/commands.d`:

    define command {
        command_name    process-host-perfdata-file
        command_line    /bin/mv /var/spool/icinga/host-perfdata /var/spool/metricinga/host-perfdata.$TIMET$
    }

    define command {
        command_name    process-service-perfdata-file
        command_line    /bin/mv /var/spool/icinga/service-perfdata /var/spool/metricinga/service-perfdata.$TIMET$
    }

Configuring Metricinga
----------------------
Metricinga is configured entirely with command-line arguments. A basic sample invocation might look like this:

    python metricinga.py --prefix nagios --host graphite.mydomain.org --daemonize

An init script for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS is included in the `redhat/` directory of the distribution. Contributions for upstart, systemd and others are welcome!
